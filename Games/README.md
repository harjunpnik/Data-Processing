# Games

The games in this folder were smaller practice exercises to learn Python. There are three games in this folder:
1. Rock, Paper, Scissors
2. Mind Reader
3. Prime Number

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

For a more specific explanation of the games you can look at games.ipynb. These games are like CLI-level games. RPS takes in players names, answers and hides it from the user that is sitting next to him. After the "logic" method is run it will print out the winner and ask if the players want to play again

## Mind Reader

The Mind Reader is a game where the program takes a random number between 1-10 and lets the user guess the number. After each guess the program will tell the player if his/her guess was lower or higher. After the user has successfully guessed the right number the program will tell how many tries it took and ask if the player wants to play again. This is also a CLI-level game.

## Prime Number

Prime number is a program that will tell if a number is a prime number or not. This was more of a exercise on logic.
