This exercise was split into 3 major parts:
1. Make a sound file
2. RGB composition
3. Hide information in pictures

## Make a sound file

The exercise was to create a sound file from scratch. We start by creating 3 different tones with sine waves and combine those to get a beautiful C-chord. After that we save the file as a .dat file and use a program called SOX to convert the file to a .wav file. 

## RGB composition 

This exercise was all about explaining how pictures are several color channels combined. In this exercise we split up those channels and combined them together to get the same picture as in the start.

## Hide information in pictures

The exercise was to hide information in a given picture. To hide the information we used the pictures alpha channel and changed its values according to a hidden message that we created ourselves.
