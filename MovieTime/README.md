# Movie Time!

For more specific explanation of the exercise solutions check the .ipynb files.

This exercise was about using the large datasets provided by MovieLens. The dataset was from 1997-1998.

This exercise was split into 5 major parts

1. Read in data
2. Choose data 
3. Filter data
4. Inspect data
5. Combine dataFrames 

## Read in data

The point was to learn to use Pandas dataFrames for easier data analysis. 

## Choose data

We rarely want to see all data so we want to choose only the data we think we can have use of.

## Filter data 

The point was to show only certain users from the data base like Men over 40, only people with the occupation of programmer

## Inspect data

We want to do some calculations to get more data from our users so we calculated out the average age of the users and the top 10 films with 40 or more ratings

## Combine dataFrames

Sometimes our dataFrames use IDs from another table. It can be very useful to see what ID 1 is for example so combining two dataFrames is very useful.
